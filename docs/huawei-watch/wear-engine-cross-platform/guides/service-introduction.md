# Service Introduction

HUAWEI Wear Engine is designed for developers of apps and services running on phones and wearable devices.

By integrating Wear Engine, your app or service on a phone can send messages and notifications and transfer data to Huawei wearable devices, as well as obtaining the status of the wearable devices. This also works the other way round, which means that an app or service on a Huawei wearable device can send messages and transfer data to a phone.

Wear Engine pools the phone's and wearable's resources and capabilities, which include the phone's apps and services and the wearable's device capabilities, creating benefits for consumers and developers alike. It enables consumers to use their devices in more diversified scenarios and receive more convenient services, with a smoother experience. It also expands the reach of your business, and takes your apps and services to the next level.

#### Open Capabilities

Wear Engine currently offers the following capabilities that are centered around Huawei wearable devices:

- Basic device capabilities:Obtaining basic information about wearable devices: A phone app can obtain a list of paired Huawei wearable devices that support HarmonyOS, such as device names and types, and query the devices' status information such as connection status and app installation status.
- App-to-app communications: A phone app and a wearable app can share messages and files (such as documents, images, and music).

- Template-based notifications on wearable devices: A phone app can send template-based notifications to wearable devices. You can customize the message title, content, and buttons.
- Obtaining the wearable user status: A phone app can query or subscribe to information such as the heart rate alerts and wearing status of wearable device users.
- Device identifier (only for enterprise partners): A phone app can obtain the serial number (SN) of wearable devices.

#### Technical Architecture
Figure 1 **Technical architecture of Wear Engine

- Wear Engine provides separate SDKs for the phone and wearable device respectively, to offer the corresponding APIs for integration into your app.
- The Huawei Health app has integrated the Wear Engine service and uses Android interface definition language (AIDL) to communicate with the Wear Engine SDK.
- Huawei wearable devices have the Wear Engine service integrated into their operating system, allowing the phone and wearable device to communicate via Bluetooth (proprietary protocol).
